Reinventing the wheel for the software development world, at least my own.

An in depth work to reinvent software development with focus on understanding,
not hurry to develop. Lazyness above all, from the good kind. Informed, patient,
method in the madness, to develop some good piece of software.

##### Creating simple tools, to make the world a better or at least simpler place

Tools:
+ Project management
+ Code refactoring
+ Code editing(make it through lines of code, descriptions or flows)

Focus:
+ Learning to program(C)
+ System programming(C)
+ Web development(to be established)
+ others to add
